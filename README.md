# ble-imu-evaluation (Work in progress)

Small proof-of-concept application to read, send and visualize orientation data from IMU-sensors in python. The goal is to get a feeling for different I2C-capable IMU sensors along with different AHRS sensor fusion algorithms. Additionally, achievable throughput rates of the ESP32 connected via BLE should be determined.
